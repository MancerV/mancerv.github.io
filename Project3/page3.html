    <h2>Things I Enjoy Doing</h2>
    <p>
      I recently picked up the piano and I'm dedicated to learning my favorite song, How to Train Your Dragon's theme song.
      I also enjoy reading manga. My manga bookmarks have been looking empty lately, so I might need to scour for more manga to read during breaks and free time.
      One of the things I found out that I really enjoy doing is listening to music with the goal of learning the language and singing the entire song with complete proficiency.
      I'm also a big music fan — any type of music that I find enjoyable, even if I don't understand the lyrics. I listen to music every chance I get. Though I have to be careful,
      because depending on the type of music I listen to, I usually feel so motivated and start some hobby that I don't continue after one day.
