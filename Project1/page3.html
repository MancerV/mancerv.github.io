        <h2> Things I Enjoy Doing</h2>
            <p> 
                I recently picked up the piano and i'm dedicated to learn my favorite song, How to train your dragon's theme song.
                I also enjoy reading manga. My manga bookmarks has been looking empty lately so I might need to scour some more manga's to read during break and every free time I get.
                One of the things I found out that i really enjoy doing is listening to music with the goal to learn that language and sing the entire song with complete proficiency.
                I'm also a big music fan, any types of music that I find enjoyable even if I don't understand te lyrics. I listen to music on every chance I get. Though i have to be carefull
                because depending on the type of music I listen, I usually feel so motivated and start some hobby that I don't continue doing  after one day
